% EXAMPLE script outline for the full pre-processing pipeline going from
% the output of Kilosort spike event detection, to peri-stimulus time
% histogram visualization of said spikes around specific DBS event
% conditions



%%  Read in spike data from Kilosort output
% Perhaps this would be done on a neuron-by-neuron basis? Or perhaps specify a
% specific desired combination of 1) DBS setting tested and 2) unique neuron spike times?




%% Create desired PSTH figure for the above-requested data




%% Any kind of quantitative analysis on said PSTH?
